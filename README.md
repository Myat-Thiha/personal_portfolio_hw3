## Baseline 2024/2025 Feature: `color-mix()`

This project demonstrates the use of the `color-mix()` function, a CSS feature from Baseline 2024. The `color-mix()` function allows developers to blend two colors in a specified color space (such as `srgb`, `oklch`, or `hsl`) to create new color values programmatically. This enables dynamic theming, tint/shade generation, and overlay effects without manual hex calculations, and works seamlessly with CSS variables for flexible, maintainable color systems.

**Implementation:** See `.demo-color-mix` class in `src/css/styles.css` (line 184).
